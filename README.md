# GiphySearch
Search for Actors Using Giphy

A Unit 6 assignment in the UMN Full Stack Web Development
Coding Boot Camp program, coded by Michael Cumings

Features
This web app starts with a number of buttons at the top each bearing the name of an actor.  When one of those buttons is clicked, it will ask the Giphy API for 10 gifs using the name on the button as the search term.  The app will then display a still image for each that conform to rating requirements (g or pg).  When one of the still images is clicked, it will switch to become an animated gif (another click will make it show the still image again).  On the right column, there is a a form consisting of a text box and a submit button.  When the submit button is pressed, the app will make a new button for the top area using the text inside the text box.  The new button should act like the previous ones. 

This app uses the API fom Giphy: https://giphy.com/
